# Who Will Win Million

This program was created using Visual Basic.Net and Visual Studio 2015.

The idea of the program is simple and relies on the interface of the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" program and the voice of George Qirdahi.

The program is used for creating questions, quizzes, and exams, such as a top students' exam or a competition among classmates.
